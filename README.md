2. WHAT IS MOTHER EARTH?
Mother Earth is a decentralized digital currency based on binance smart chain technology that trades with "MOT" symbol. This new and ingenious technological concept increases the security of the currency and allows verification of transactions.
MotherEarth is an eco-friendly crypto-currency developed in collaboration with some of the best minds of Blockchain Technology. Our objective is to provide a reliable cryptocurrency for both who are looking for investment and for doing transactions via Crypto. Our team is already in talks with various Corporations and Governments globally to get it approved as a tender for transactions. Gateways for crypto as a tender have already been opened up.
Further to counter our carbon footprint and give back to society, we have pledged to plant 2 million trees by end of 2022 in collaboration with various NGOs, which already began while the coin was still in it's testing stage. MotherEarth is working towards repairing the ecosystem is an integral part of its identity. Although it is multi-faceted, we have decided to address this as one of its principals - by planting trees, for "he who plants a tree plants a hope". It is our responsibility towards our ecosystem to make efforts and harness our energy and

resources to put back what we are taking away and help this world become a better place and be answerable to our future generations.
To make progress as planned, we would join hands with our partners and supporters throughout the reforestation process, from planting saplings and taking care of young trees, through to their establishment. In our quest, we intend to have various forces rally alongside us - influencers across various channels, private investors as well as charitable organisations that will be chosen by the community as we mature in time.
3. VISION
Mother Earth is a project aiming to improve the life on our planet. The core of the project is the “MOT” Token. The MOT token is a blockchain based cryptocurrency.
Our main goal is recording atmospheric data to our blockchain and planting trees. In order to reach our goal we will take a small percent of the value of the MOT token and put it towards planting trees.
The amount of produced oxygen and carbon dioxide will be measured by specialized atmospheric sensors that will send information directly to the blockchain. All logs will be secure on

the blockchain with no possibility for any kind of tempering or erasing any data by anyone.
The information will be widely available to all the users.
4. MOTHER EARTH FOUNDATION
The shareholders of the foundation appoint the Executive Board members.
Their duty is to act on full moral responsibility and integrity. The Executive Board members must take into consideration primarily the entire community and all the stakeholders of Mother Earth.
The executive board members will have the right to make strategic decisions, coin distribution ratios, revenue share distribution in order to sustain the growth.
In order for a revenue share distribution to take place , the Mother Earth Foundation will need to buy tokens from the exchanges.
With the increased sales of tokens as a result of the purchases made by the Mother Earth Foundation there will be a positive influence on the token market. To ensure that no misuse of data, no fraud takes place and no trading happens, all effective security measures and moral standards ought to be enforced

by the Executive Board members. The Mother Earth foundation will work around the clock.
Different levels of authority are awarded to different sectors of the foundation.
They must approve every strategic decision such as budget revision, fund allocation, investment etc. directly to the Executive Board report the management team as well as the CFO. They all are tasked with different responsibilities and therefore have different authorities. The CFO reports to the Executive Board for reporting, audit and internal control purposes.
The management team needs to prepare the annual budget for marketing and operations. Whereas the managing director has the right to spend within the limits of the previously approved annual budget. If a payment over the limit needs to be performed a signature from an Executive Board member and the Managing director is required.
In addition, the Managing Director has a some authority over the Power of Attorney.

5. THE NEED OF MOTHER EARTH TOKEN
We have only one planet for a healthier and sustainable life. We as human kind produce way more carbon dioxide than our planet can take. Our planet is suffocating due to lack of oxygen. One of the ways to make our planet safer and healthier is to plant more trees. Planting trees increases the oxygen levels in the atmosphere. At the same time trees during their photosynthesis use carbon dioxide which helps slow down the green garden effect.
In addition trees contribute to the lowering of the temperature of Earth, which is at an all time high in the recent years.
6. CARBON EMISSIONS IN THE WORLD
Global carbon emissions are increasing every day. With each year we are passing the previous year record for carbon emissions globally. The carbon emissions are reaching terrifying high levels. It is predicted, according by the science magazine, that by the end of the year the numbers will reach a record high 36.8 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. It is predicted that the number will continue to grow, thus we must take action to reduce our carbon footprint.

Each country’s share of CO2 emissions
Source: https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/each-countrys- share-co2-emissions
Preliminary estimates, show that the EU greenhouse gas emissions have decreased by 0.4 % in 2016 and were closely followed by an 0.6% increase in 2017.
The 2017 levels are corresponded with the 22 % reduction from 1990 levels, which is more than the EU reduction target of 20 % by 2020.
 
According to Member States’ projections reported in 2017 and 2018:
▪ Greenhouse gas emissions in the EU are expected to decrease further by 2020 to 26 % below 1990 levels with the current measures that are already in place; 32 % reduction of EU greenhouse gas emissions could be achieved by 2030, compared with 1990 levels. These projected reductions fall short of the 40 % target for 2030.
The total greenhouse emissions of the European union including international aviation and indirect CO2 are calculated by combining all the greenhouse emissions from each country individually.
How does planting trees help fight climate changes?
A recent study shows that one of the best ways if not the best one for fighting climate changes is planting trees. It is well known by now that trees help fight climate change, but how exactly. Trees during the process of photosynthesis metabolise carbon dioxide and release oxygen. Photosynthesis is a process that plants use to fuel their growth.
It is a process in which through the use of sunlight and the aid of carbon dioxide organisms produce energy for their daily needs. In addition to the energy produced they also produce and release oxygen.

The carbon dioxide is stored in the trees and the soil beneath them. As the tree grows it needs more and more carbon dioxide and produces more oxygen. Each tree through its lifetime will remove about 7 tons of carbon dioxide.
With the decreasing amount of carbon dioxide and the increased amount of oxygen in the atmosphere the climate changes are stopped or at least reversed.
With the decreasing amount of carbon dioxide and the increased amount of oxygen in the atmosphere the climate changes are stopped or at least reversed.
Although planting trees may seem as the perfect solution to the high carbon emission problem, a recent study has shown that the rise in temperature may lead to shorter life span of trees. According to the study since the temperature is higher the growth season of the trees is longer and therefore the trees grow at a higher rate.
Unfortunately, this leads to a faster and shorter life span of the trees. They do grow full size and accumulate much more carbon dioxide than usual, but they also die faster than usual. This is something that should be kept in mind.
Three hypotheses for what happens to trees that grow faster than the average.

Planting trees
One of the most important parts of our project Mother Earth is restoring the oxygen levels in our atmosphere. The simplest way to accomplish this mission of ours is by planting trees.
As we all know deforestation in recent years is a major ecological problem from a few points. One of the most important consequences of deforestation is the decreased amount of oxygen produced as the carbon footprint of the World continues to increase.
In order for our planet to have a fighting chance with global warming we need to plant 500 billion trees every year. The traditional process of planting trees is slow and requires a lot of manual work. Up until now the only way to plant trees was to get a seedling on your back and plant it yourself or hire someone to do it for you, nonetheless it required a lot of strenuous physical labour, and the process did not have high success rate. The success rate was attributed to human mistakes in the process of planting and not giving enough nutrients to the seed to grow in a healthy tree.
This is why, We at Mother Earth were determined to find a way to plant as many trees as possible with the highest rate of success. Through a lot of research and consultation with

experts in the field, we discovered that the best results are obtained by the use of a drone, specially made for planting trees. The drone can plant up to 100 times faster than a traditional tree planting operation. However, its not just the speed that is an advantage. In addition to the speed the success rate is also incredibly higher than those of a traditional planting operation.
The drones work very systematically with the help of planting experts. The process begins with the mapping of the terrain through detailed photos and the determination of the soil and what kind of nutrients the seed will need to grow in a healthy tree. The next step is to create a detailed scheme with the exact placement of every seed. The drone is programmed and loaded with biodegradable capsules. Each capsule contains a seed and the specific nutrients that will ensure its growth in that exact location. After the planting drones are ready, they fly at about 10 feet of the ground and fire the biodegradable capsule at the previously designated places. Then the outer layer of the biodegradable capsule decomposes and releases all the nutrients and the seed.
This way of planting will ensure we have the most efficient and effective results in the shortest time possible. With this way of

planting trees, we will increase both our number of seeds planted per day and the success rate.
This is why we will provide a tree planting drone and hire all the necessary staff and specialists that are needed, to make sure that every planting expedition is as successful as possible with the highest number of planted trees possible.
How does it work?
Once the token is created and established the whole process will be quite simple.
The idea is that part of the value of the token will be put toward planting trees. There are two ways through which this can be accomplished.
The first one we locate, facilitate and fund the whole process or we start a cooperation with a non-profit organization whose main goal is planting trees.
By cooperating with an already existing non-profit organization the whole process will be much simpler and we believe there will be a bigger impact.

Once defined the planting areas the users will be able to choose where trees will be planted as a result of their purchase.
Keeping us accountable
Our data for the amounts of oxygen and carbon emitted will come from external CO2 and O2 atmospheric sensors directly to our blockchain. Parameters that will be recorder by the sensors are CO2 and O2 levels, temperature and humidity.
It will be stored automatically to the blockchain without the possibility for any kind of outside interference. This means that no one will be able to in any way alter or delete the log received by the sensors.
All the sensors will be connected at all times with Wi-Fi or mobile network and will be emitting the data live. Every one will have access to the information registered on the blockchain. The information can be accessed through our mobile application, web site or blockchain. This is the most secure, environmentally friendly and transparent way of keeping the information.

Green Climate Tracker Portal
Our atmospheric sensors will be equipped with unique identification number. Once a user register to our network they will be awarded a unique identification number. This identification number will be used for logging on to the blockchain where all the information will be stored. With the use of such unique Identification numbers we will be able to provide the exact location and time the information was collected.
The information that our atmospheric sensors will provide are levels of carbon dioxide and oxygen as well as the level of humidity and temperature. All the collected information will be automatically stored on our blockchain without the possibility for any kind of tempering with the collected information. Meaning no one will be able to alter the numbers or erase anything.
To ensure all of the data are collected regularly and on time all our atmospheric sensors will be connected to Wi-Fi or mobile network at all times. This means that we will have real time information about the impact of our project.
The collected information will be available to the wide public. Not just our users, but every one will be able to reach the collected information. They will have access through our web site, blockchain and mobile app.

All the measures that are put in place is to ensure that our clients can have access at all times to the information and feel secure. One of our most important objectives is to be transparent and share the information that we acquire.
Mobile & Desktop Application (Wallet)
The users will be able to use their MOT Tokens through specially designed application which will be available for use on multiple devices. The Mother Earth application is designed to act as a wallet to the users.
In order to create a unique wallet every individual will need to download the application and register their phone number.
In future the application users will be able to have real life updates on the information sent to the blockchain from the atmospheric sensors. The information from the sensors that will be available are concentrations of CO2 O2 temperature and humidity.
Within the application "Customer Relations" support is provided for any issues the customers may run into. Also, customers can easily access the support through the social media accounts.

Technical Design Supply Algorithms
Mother Earth utilized on the Binance Smart Chain platform using BEP-20 technology which is public, easy-to-use. Whether it is transactions between two dynamics or stock exchanges, all operations are held much faster than the existing banking system by the blockchain technology.
BEP-20 is a token standard on Binance Smart Chain that extends ERC-20, the most common Ethereum token standard. You can think of it as a blueprint for tokens that defines how they can be spent, who can spend them, and other rules for their usage. Due to its similarity to Binance Chain’s BEP-2 and Ethereum’s ERC-20, it’s compatible with both.
• Function as a currency,
• A share in the company
• Points in a loyalty program
• Proof of ownership (e.g. Deed to a house)
A smart contract is a computer protocol on the blockchain which technically orders projects. Smart contracts are the unchangeable agreements on how transactions are approved according to the rules written within them. They are responsible

for the autonomous ruling of the system. Smart contracts basically act as objective escrow mechanisms.

7. FEATURES
Community Driven
Mother Earth is fully decentralized and owned by its community. It empowers its holders to participate for decision making with greater accountability for the future of Mother Earth. We work to build opportunities, strengthen the voice of community to promote sustainable development.
Automatic Liquidity
Every trade generates automatic liquidity that goes into multiple pools. Automatic liquidated pool is a safeguard for our community as it works in two ways. Firstly, whenever there is a trade and a particular amount of transaction fees is charged, the fees will be deposited into the liquidity pool from both the sale and purchase ends, which will increase the liquidity pool and will stabilise the price fluctuations to its maximum.
Secondly, this transaction fees serves as an arbitrage resistant mechanism as it provides further security to the token volume, rewarding its community. When you make a token swap (trade) on the exchange, you will pay a 5% trading fee, which is broken down as follows:

- 2% - to its yield farming pool - 3% - to its liquidity pool
As the LP increases, the stability of the token increases, which in turn benefits its holders by providing a solid price floor. Without a LP function, the price fluctuations maybe large if big holders plan to sell their entire holding. To prevent and cushion such high fluctuations in price, is the goal of an automatic LP here.
Security
100% liquidity will be locked for 2 years.
Manual Burns
49% of the Mother Earth tokens will be burned in time. For a coin burn to take place, the tokens are sent to an address where they can't be spent. As nobody has access to the private key associated with that particular address, those particular tokens are removed from circulation and the token supply is intentionally lowered. The coin burn address is made public to verify that the coins have indeed been burned. So the 1 billion supply initially, will diminish in the following years, and with a decrease in supply and increase in the demand of the token, the value would increase, thereby benefiting its holders.

Network
New transactions are broadcast to all the nodes. The longest chains are always considered to be the correct ones by the nodes and they keep working on extending them.

10. USE OF PROCEEDS
A decentralized eco-friendly community where MOT token holders earn passive rewards and support environment-centred projects that benefit local tree growers who are doing the hard work in restoring our ecosystem.
10 Billion newly planted and mature trees worldwide are geo- tagged by 2025, minted and stored in the blockchain. Those trees are minted as NFTs and can be traded for MOT token in MOTHEREARTH adoption market.
Our mission is to make sure that tree improvement, long-term maintenance and end-use of the trees are monitored, traceable and authenticated.
We also want to make sure that our technology creates environmental and economic value and can serve as a reliable

source of income for millions of smallholder tree growers worldwide.
With cross-chain mobile application and blockchain technology, we provide a traceability solution for trees and ownership authentication as well as economic benefits to our App users. The mechanism employs a pay-to-grow-tend-track-model, which allows app users to measure real tree attributes and get an equivalent MOT token for the amount of CO2 the tree absorbed as a carbon offset. MOT token can be bought and held as an asset, or burnt to offset an individual’s carbon footprint.
Navigate to our App prototype by clicking the button to get a preview of the tree monitoring app. Final features are being developed to obtain accurate and reliable data to be published soon.
